<H1>Documentation</H1>
This is an index to a rather wide range of documents of differing quality and age concerning the
open computer forensics architecture and its usage. Some very much deprecated existing documentation 
has been left, and some slightly outdated documents have been included, in an attempt to reach a 
compromise between completeness and up-to-date documentation. A limited set of documents was recently
added or rewritten for the sake of completeness.
