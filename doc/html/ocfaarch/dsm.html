<h2>The data storage module</h2>
The data store module is always the <i>final</i> module in the life of
a piece of evidence. During its stay in the open computer forensics
architecture, the metadata belonging to a particular evidence data only
exists within the xml representation as administered by the <a
 href="../ocfalib/evidencelib.html">evidence library</a>. Once the <a
 href="router.html">router</a> has determined it has no further modules
that could extract or expand metadata or data from the evidence, it is
finally sent to the data store module (dsm). This module will parse the
xml through the evidence library and will store relevant metadata
within the database for the active case.
