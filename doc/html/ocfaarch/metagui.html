<h2>The OCFA Graphical User Interface<br>
</h2>
<div class="shout"><b>Web based GUI:</b><br>
The tactical investigator can view the results without the requirement of installing
dedicated software on his workstation.</div>
<p>The graphical user interface of ocfa is based on a collection
of cgi scripts and programs running on an Apache webserver.Using this interface 
it is possible to browse the results on a workstation
without installing dedicated ocfa software. Everything is server based, allowing
web access to the results.</p>
<p>There are several interfaces to browse through the results.
There are interfaces for:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Viewing the metadata tree based on the case hierarchy, with the
evidence as starting point.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Searching for (combinations of) words in the text.</li>
  <li>A view on the queues/buffers of the anycast router. <br>
  </li>
  <li>An overview of the metadata found, usable to search matching evidences.</li>
  <li>An overview of all graphical images using thumbnails.</li>
  <li>A collection of time line calendar view.</li>
</ul>
All views and overviews have the possibility to drill down to the
original data and showing the corresponding metadata.
<p>Some of the views are instantly accessibly, also during the
operation
of the running architecture. Instant accessible views are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Viewing the metadata tree.</li>
  <li>A view of the anycast buffers.</li>
</ul>
Other views are only accessible after finishing the process and calling
the appropriate commands for creating overviews and optimizing the database
for querying. See the <A HREF="../usage/quickstart.html">quick start reference</A>
for information about this.
<ul>
  <li>Searching for (combination of) words in the text.</li>
