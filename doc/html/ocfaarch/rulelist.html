<h2>Rulelist</h2>
<p> The rulelist is a semicolon separated file (the operator also may
use the comma or pipe symbol "|" as legal separator symbols). We
are planning a replacement of this field based text file by an XML
rulelist file with more flexibility for the next version of OCFA.</p>
<p>You as operator can use the rulelist in order to <i>program</i> the evidence flow
through the Computer Forensics Architecture. That is: to define the sequence of
modules to process the evidence. </p>
<p>The idea behind the rulelist is roughly based on the iptables
implementation. In the source distribution several example rulelists are
included (an example tells more than a thousand words). After
installation, the rulelists can be found in the ${OCFAROOT}/etc
directory. The rulelist actually used during processing is defined in
the <A HREF="../usage/ocfa_conf.html">ocfa configuration file</A>.</p>
<h3>Rule lines</h3>
<p>The current version of the rulelist is a line based text file. Each
line defines a rule. The maximum number of rulelines is defined in the
<A HREF="../usage/ocfa_conf.html">ocfa configuration file</A> . The rule line is mainly
devided into three main parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Table name (not currently used)</li>
  <li>Packet section</li>
  <li>Final action section</li>
</ol>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Table name<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Packet section<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Final action field<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>Example of three rulelines from an actual rulelist:</p>
<p class="example">default;DNTCR;mimetype;image/jpeg;DNTCR;ACT_FORWARD;exif;<br>
default;DNTCR;mimetype;application/msword;DNTCR;ACT_FORWARD;antiword;<br>
default;DNTCR;mimetype;application/x-zip;DNTCR;ACT_FORWARD;zip;</p>
<p>In the following section the three fields are further explained.</p>
<h3>Table name</h3>
<p>The table name fields is not used for a routing decision at this
moment.
The value is set to "<span style="font-style: italic;">default</span>".
In this implementation only a single table is available and this puts
some strain on how expressive the rulelist can be built. Future
versions of the router will include support for jumping between multiple tables
in order to allow routing on multiple metadata fields and in order to
allow (per table) routing based on metadata added by modules
before the previous module.</p>
<h3>Packet section</h3>
<p>The router uses the packet section to base the routing decision on. The
packet section contains four restrictive selection
fields:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The namespace. An exact match on the namespace of the metadata.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The type. An exact match on the type of the metadata.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The value. A "part of" (substring) match of the actual value of
the metadata.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The module name of the module that added the metadata.</li>
</ol>
<p>A match of the packet field will fire the final action defined in the
same ruleline.</p>
<p>For each field in the packet section you may use the reserved "DNTCR" value. This
means "don't care". In the example the value for the namespace does not
influence the routing decision. All values from the metadata will match
here. It is not a good practice to use "DNTCR" for all four fields.
This rule will match for sure and the rulelist will exit at this point,
never reaching the rulelines following (see matching strategies section
below) . For this purpose a default routing is defined in the ocfa
configuration file. Firing the default routing will cause a warning
message in the logging. A properly constructed  rulelist should prevent 
the firing of the default rule.</p>
<h3>Final Action field</h3>
<p>Future versions of the router shall have support for side-actions
(logging, adding metadata etc) to make the router even more expressive.
In the current version of the rulelist the operator can use the action
field to define the final action on a evidence. The final action has
three fields:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Action type field. See defined actions below.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Action target field. The target module to send the evidence to in
the case of an ACT_FORWARD action type.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Action argument field. Optional, not implemented yet.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the ocfa configuration file, a rulelist section defines the default
action in the case no ruleline matches.</p>
<h4>Action type field</h4>
<p>The following final action types are defined:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ACT_FORWARD. This will send the evidence to the module type
defined in the target field.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ACT_COMMIT. This will store the evidence in the DSM. No further
processing needed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ACT_SUSPEND. This will prevent the evidence from further
processing, until a user action is given to continue.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ACT_ERROR. Not implemented.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Planned extensions to this list are:<br>
<ol>
  <li>ACT_JUMP. This will trigger a jump action to the table defined in
the target field.</li>
</ol>
The complete ruleline looks like this:<br>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">table name<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">namespace<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">meta type<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">meta value<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">last module<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">action type<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">action target<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">action argument<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<h2>Matching strategy</h2>
Like the iptables implementation, the rulelist has a top down
approach. The first best line matching the metadata coming with the
evidence under consideration will fire the defined final action. Only
all metadata of the last job will be evaluated against the defined
packets. <br>
<br>
This means that the most specific lines have to been put on top of the
rulelist and the most general lines on the bottom of the rulelist.
Don't use a general catch line with all DNTCR values as packet
parameters. This is already implemented as an ocfa configuration item.<br>
