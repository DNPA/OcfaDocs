<h2>Minimal modules</h2>
In the Open Computer Forensics Architecture modules are processes that
use the <a href="../ocfalib/ocfalib.html">ocfalib</a> library and do
some processing on evidence data or on metadata belonging to this
evidence data. The modules can be
divided up into 3 main groups, depending on their functionality.
Depending on the group they are in they
will require access to specific parts of the <a
 href="../ocfalib/ocfalib.html">ocfalib</a> API.

This means that a module of a specific type will get a kind of
capability for accessing the relevant parts of the API (In the 1.0
version these were actual compile time enforced capabilities that got
factored out in the 2.0 due to several issues not relevant here). Next
to iteratable metadata that is used by <a href="expander.html">expander</a>
modules, the <a href="../ocfalib/ocfalib.html">ocfalib</a> API also
gives access to some very generic non optional metadata. This means
that a module that does not need access to any of the 3 capabilities
described above would be a <b>minimal</b> module. Currently the
distribution comes only with a single minimal module, the digest module.<br>
<h3>The digest module</h3>
<div class="shout"><b>Positive or negative hit:</b><br>
The digest
of each evidence gives the opportunity to generate positive or negative
hits,
depending on the database referencing the found digest. Evidence with a
digest found in the NIST database can be ignored, but when found in the
child abuse database
a trigger should happen.</div>
The digest module compares the calculated digest against known
hashsets.
The <a href="../ocfalib/ocfalib.html">ocfalib</a> library calculates
the hashes (md5 and sha1) triggered by
the <a href="../ocfaarch/kickstart.html">kickstart</a>, <a
 href="../ocfaarch/eekickstart.html">eekickstart</a> or a <a
 href="dissectors.html">dissector</a> module while inserting or
deriving the evidence.<br>
<br>
Evidence may be known by its digest to one or more software and/or
data library databases like that made available by NIST. The NIST
database contains
the digests of many known software product files. Other digest sources
might provide the digests of known child abuse image libraries or of
any
distinct set of known files. The digest module will request the digests
from each evidence it receives, and will lookup these digests in a set
of Berkeley db database files. If it finds the digest, it will add some
metadata values to the metadata of the evidence data instance, among
which is the <i>digestsource</i>. Next to this it will record the
digest of any unknown evidence data it processes so that when a second
version of the same evidence data is submitted to the digest module, it
will remember that it has seen the file before and will add metadata
stating <i>digestsource=SELF</i> to indicate the data has been seen
and processed before in this case. The <a
 href="../ocfaarch/router.html">router</a> may use this
information&nbsp; implemented in the rulelist for further processing.<br>
<br>
<h4>The digestdb creation script</h4>
The digest module uses a Berkeley db file containing some basic
information about the origins of known files. A script is available to
convert files in the formatting as defined by NIST for their digest
sets. In the source distribution you will find this script in
OcfaModules/minimal/digest/init/, it is named <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">createshadb2.pl</span>. In order
to call this script you should first create a text file that points to
the location of your NIST style digest information. This file should
contain a set of lines. Each Line should begin with the name of the
digest source (for example NIST) followed by the location of the
relevant product file and the location of one or more digest files.<br>
