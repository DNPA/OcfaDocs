<h2>Dissector modules</h2>
Dissector type modules can do a little more than the <a
 href="extractors.html">extractor</a> type modules. They are able to <i>derive</i>
evidence data from evidence data that is handed to them. Basically a
dissector dissects a file into one or more files.
<h3>antiword</h3>
The antiword module is a simple wrapper around antiword program, used
to extract the text from a Microsoft Word file.
<h3>pdftotext</h3>
The pdftotext module is a simple wrapper around pdftotext, used to
extract the text from a pdf file.
<h3>bzip</h3>
The bzip module is a simple wrapper around bunzip2 used to decompress
bzip2 compressed files.
<h3>gzip</h3>
The gzip module is a simple wrapper around gunzip used to decompress
gzip compressed files.
<h3>tar</h3>
The tar module is a simple wrapper around tar used to dissect a tar
archive into its components.
<h3>zip</h3>
The zip module is a simple wrapper around unzip used to dissect a zip
archive into its components.
<h3>mailwash</h3>
The mailwash module is a wrapper around a perl script that extracts
files and metadata from e-mail files. This module also works with unix
mbox files, however the parent child relationships will not work as
expected.
<h3>sleuthkit</h3>
The sleuthkit module is a wrapper around a perl script that itself
again is a wrapper around the 2.04 version of the sleuthkit. The script
tries to unpack image files (encase,dd,aff) into a directory tree.
Please note that this module is seen as a temporary quick hack to get
support for encase and dd images into the open computer forensics
architecture. In the near future this functionality will move to <a
 href="../ocfalib/ocfalib.html">ocfalib</a>. The <a
 href="../ocfalib/storelib.html">storelib</a> will then use <i>libewf</i>
and <i>libaff</i> for direct efficient storage of encase and aff
files, while the <a href="../ocfalib/fslib.html">fs abstraction</a>
library will get a loadable module for access to the different
sleuthkit libraries. Until these fixes become available, encase,dd and
aff support will be limited to the data-only export provided by the
wrapper script.
<h3>strings</h3>
The strings module is a simple wrapper around the strings program. It
is used to try and extract text content from arbitrary content.<br>
