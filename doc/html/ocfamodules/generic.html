<h2>Generic modules</h2>
In some cases a module might be created that requires both the
capabilities of a <a href="dissectors.html">dissector</a> and of an <a
 href="expander.html">expander</a>. There are currently no examples
available of this type. The 1.0 version of the open computer forensics
architecture had a module providing generic module functionality to
modules written in perl. This module has however not yet been ported to
the 2.0 version.
