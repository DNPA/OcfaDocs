<h2>Extractor modules</h2>
The extractor module class expands the <a href="minimal.html">minimal</a>
modules with the capability to <i>read</i> the evidence data. This
capability is used by extractor modules to extract specific metadata
from the evidence data that is then added to the metadata of that
evidence data.
<h3>jFile</h3>
The jFile or file module is a module that uses libmagic to determine
the type of a given evidence. If the file is recognized as being
Microsoft Office it will determine more specifically what type of office
package (Word, Excel, etc) was used, and will add all found information
as metadata to the given evidence.
<h3>luceneindexer</h3>
The lucene indexer does not add any metadata to the evidence data,
instead it tokenizes the data and adds any given evidence data to a
searchable index.
<h3>pkr</h3>
In pgp public keyring files a mapping from pgp key id's to names and
e-mail addresses can be found. The pkr module uses gpg to extract a
table of relevant metadata from a keyring file and adds it as metadata
to the evidence data. Ones the <a href="../ocfaarch/dsm.html">data
store module</a> has stored the data in the database, this can be used
to expand on any data found by the pgp module.
<h3>pgp</h3>
Pgp encrypted files always contain the key-id of the pgp key of the
person who they were targeted at, Pgp signed files contain the key-id
of the pgp key of the person who signed the file. The pgp module uses gpg
to extract these key id's from the pgp signed and pgp encrypted files
and adds them to the evidence data as metadata.
<h3>exif</h3>
Many graphical image files that were made with a digital camera contain
so called exif information. The exif module extracts most of this meta
data from the graphical image evidence data and adds it as metadata.
<h3>objdump</h3>
Executable files are divided up into sections, these sections often
have a name, and also have some specific flags. A specific set of
interesting flags are those stating if the segment contains <i>code</i>
and those stating if a segment is <i>read-only</i>. If a section is
code but is not marked as read only, this mostly means that the
executable is packed. If you are looking for malware on a system
looking at packed executables is a good way to start. The objdump
module adds the section names to the metadata and if the executable if
found to be packed, this information is also added as metadata.
