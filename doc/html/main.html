<p>The Open Computer Forensics Architecture (OCFA) is a modular
computer forensics framework built by the Dutch National Police Agency.
The main goal is to automate the digital forensic process to speed up
the investigation and give tactical investigators direct access to the
seized data through an easy to use search and browse interface.
</p>
<p>
The architecture forms an environment where existing forensic tools and
libraries can be easily plugged into the architecture and can thus be
made part of the recursive extraction of data and metadata from digital
evidence.
</p>
<p>
The Open Computer Forensics Architecture aims to be highly modular,
robust, fault tolerant, recursive and scalable in order to be usable in
large investigations that spawn numerous terabytes of evidence data and
covers hundreds of evidence items.<br>
