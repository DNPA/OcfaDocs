<h2>The OCFA inter process messaging library</h2>
The message library offers the facilities to communicate simple short
messages between processes within the open computer forensics
architecture. In a normal configuration any normal module including
those within OcfaArch is configured as a messaging client, and the <a
 href="../ocfaarch/anycast.html">anycast relay</a> is configured as a
messaging server. Basically all clients connect to a single server that
acts as a relay between addressable nodes (module instances). Messages
sent between the processes can be of the following types:
<ul>
  <li>Unicast messages : messages directed at a specific module
instance. </li>
  <li>Broadcast messages: messages directed at all connected modules. </li>
  <li>Anycast messages: messages directed at 'any' instances of a
specific module type. </li>
  <li>Multicast messages: messages directed at all modules that are
subscribes to a specific channel. </li>
</ul>
Normal modules will use Anycast messaging to communicate evidence data
and metadata with other modules. Special messages like ocfahalt will be
sent using Broadcast or Multicast. A special process called the <a
 href="../ocfaarch/anycast.html">anycast relay</a> is able to turn
anycast messages into unicast messages for specific module instances.
By using anycasts, a distributed environment can be built where multiple
instances of a particular module can be run on different computers. The
anycast will take care of the load balancing, buffering and addresses
the reliability.
