<h2>The OCFA library for module creation</h2>
<div class="shout"><b>OCFAROOT:</b><br>
The in the shell exported path
to the root directory of the ocfa installation. For example
"/usr/local/digiwash2.0/"</div>
The ocfa library is the library used by all modules to plug into the
open computer forensics architecture. Basically a program in order to
become a module will need to subclass from one of the accessor classes
defined in "${OCFAROOT}/inc/facade/" implying the definition and
implementation of the pure virtual processEvidence method for this
class. The main of the
program should call the run method after instantiating the implemented
subclass in order to activate the process as open
computer forensics architecture module.<br>
<br>
The OCFA library basically forms the glue between the four main sub
libraries of the open computer forensics architecture:
<ul>
  <li><a href="fslib.html">The filesystem abstraction library</a> </li>
  <li><a href="evidencelib.html">The xml evidence metadata library</a> </li>
  <li><a href="storelib.html">The data repository library</a> </li>
  <li><a href="msglib.html">The messaging library</a> </li>
</ul>
Basically the library can receive messages through the messaging
libraries. These messages contain handles for retrieving xml meta data
and data from the storelib. The evidence library provides metadata
access and extension possibilities. If a directory tree (or in the near
future
an image) is submitted, the fs library is used to extract the data and
metadata from this directory and its content. The metadata can then be
mapped to xml using the evidence library, and can together with the xml
be stored using the store library. A handle retrieved from the storelib
is then used to construct a message to send the evidence to the
intended module.
