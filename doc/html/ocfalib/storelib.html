<h2>The OCFA data storage library</h2>
The storage library aims to efficiently store evidence data and
evidence xml metadata. Currently this is done by storing any data by
its sha1 digest in order to eliminate multiple storage of the same
content. The core functionality of the store library is to allow for
the efficient storage and retrieval of evidence data and metadata. The
storage library currently is being revised and a new more efficient
version
will come available that has full fragment support and uses libewf and
libaff. Later versions will include better support for network based
storage that don't rely on samba or nfs file sharing and should make a
distributed
environment easier to setup.
