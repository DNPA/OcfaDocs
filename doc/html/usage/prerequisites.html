     <H2>Prerequisites</H2>
     If you choose to use the seperate source trees without the packages and howto
     for installation, than you will need to make sure ale prerequisites for installation
     are satified prior to building and installing.
     <H3>Partitioning</H3>
     It is strongly sugested that you choose to have your /var on its own sufficiently
     large partition. This partition should preferably be formatted with the XFS
     filesystem. A good alternative to XFS could be Reiser. It is known that the
     storage library of the open computer forensics architecture has relatively poor performance on
     ext2/ext3 filesystems, and you are for this reason sugested to choose XFS (or Reiser) over
     ext2/ext3 for your /var partition.
     <H3>Prerequisites for OcfaLib</H3>
     For the installation of OcfaLib you will need to have tehe folowing libraries installed
     with the complete set of include files available (many distributions put these in a seperate
     <i>development</i> package for the library)
     <ul>
     <li>The Xerces C++ library version 2.6 or higher.
     <li>The boost libraries with at least the serialization library.
     <li>The ACE communication framework library.
     <li>The openssl library.
     <li>The postgres sql library.
     <li>The zlib library
     </ul>
     Next to these libraries you will need to make sure you have basic building tools like <i>libtool</i> 
     <i>make</i> and <i>g++</i> installed on your system. The use of the 4.0 version of g++ is discouraged,
     3.4 or 4.1 are preferable.
     <H3>Prerequisites for OcfaArch</H3>
     The main prerequisit for OcfaArch is that you have OcfaLib installed and have the group <i>ocfa</i>
     defined on your system. Next to this OcfaArch has a few more prerequisites.
     <ul>
       <li>The cgicc cgi library.
       <li>The clucene indexing library.
       <li>The boost regular expression library
     </ul>
     Next to these libraries you will need to have the folowing server software up and running 
     on your system:
     <ul>
       <li>postgress 8
       <li>apache 2
       <li>syslogd
     </ul>
     Finaly you will need to have the <i>netpbm</i> graphic conversion tools installed on your system.
     <H3>OcfaArch prerequisites</H3>
     The OcfaModules consists of a set of different modules each with its own tool or library as a prerequisite.
     This means you could leave out one or more of these prerequisites, and make do without the
     related module if need be, you are however sugested to install all of these tools and libraties:
     <ul>
         <li>The sleuthkit version 2.04 or higher.
	 <li>libmagic
	 <li>berkeley db 4.x
	 <li>gunzip
	 <li>bunzip2
	 <li>objdump
	 <li>exiftags
	 <li>unzip
	 <li>antiword
	 <li>pdftotext 
	 <li>strings
	 <li>tar
	 <li>perl
	 <li>Perl modules:<ul>
                             <li>Mime-tools
