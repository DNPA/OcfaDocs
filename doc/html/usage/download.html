<h2>Downloading the Open Computer Forensics Architecture</h2>
<h3>Choosing what to download</h3>
Before you download the open computer forensics architecture, we need
to say a little about supported platforms. In theory the open computer
forensics architecture currently should be able to <i>run</i> on at
least any recent Linux distribution, and with only a little loss of
functionality even on other posix systems like BSD OSX and Solaris. If
you consider yourself a competent unix administrator you will probably
be able to install the open computer forensics architecture on any of
these platforms from analyzing the Linux install scripts in the
distribution. If however you have either little time and/or have unix
knowledge on an intermediate level, you will probably prefer to use one
of the four currently fully tested Linux distributions for the
installation of the open computer forensics architecture.
<ul>
  <li>Debian etch (currently also known as testing) </li>
  <li>Ubuntu 5.10 </li>
  <li>Suse 10.1 </li>
  <li>Suse 9.3 </li>
</ul>
For each of these Linux distributions you can download a relevant
distribution file. This file will come with an installation howto and a
set of packages of third party software needed to use or install the
open computer forensics architecture. This means that such a
distribution file will be relatively big. As an alternative for more
competent unix users you can choose to look at the <a
 href="prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a> for installation and
install everything from the source. For this we have the 3 parts of the
open computer forensics architecture distributed as separate source
distribution files.
<ul>
  <li>OcfaLib: the core libraries. </li>
  <li>OcfaArch: the core architectural module set. </li>
  <li>OcfaModules: a set of basic modules. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Downloading</h3>
In order to download th appropriate package or packages please go to
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/ocfa/">project
