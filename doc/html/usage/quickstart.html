<h2>How to get started using the Open Computer Forensics Architecture</h2>
After you have installed the open computer forensics architecture on
your system you can start to use it. This page tries to give a short
introduction how to use the open computer forensics architecture.
<h3>Setting up hostnames</h3>
<div class="shout"><b>Example: /etc/hosts</b><br>
A line from the hosts file could look like<br>
172.16.4.123 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; zaak123.ocfa.loc
</div>
There are two ways to set up the proper hostnames for your system.
The
ideal way is using dns. You simply set a wildcard dns record for <i>*.ocfa.loc</i>
to point to the ip address of your main ocfa server system. A second
more limited but rather simple way is by updating the /etc/hosts file
of both your ocfa server and your web client systems. For each case you
plan to create, a &lt;casename&gt;.ocfa.loc as name with your IP
address
has to be added, so your server and web clients will be able to locate
your system by its case name.
<h3>Creating your case</h3>
In order to be able to run your system, you will now first need to
create a case. You should log in as (or su to) the user <i>ocfa</i>.
You will when logging in as ocfa always be asked to name the case you
will be working on. Answering this only sets an environment variable
nothing more. Once you are in the shell you should create a case. Lets
assume you have chosen <i>ocfa</i> as the password for your database
server for the user ocfa, and that the case you want to create is
called <i>testcase</i>. Than you create the new case by calling
<pre class="example">createcase.pl testcase ocfa<br>     </pre>
<h3>Restarting the webserver</h3>
After creating a new case, a new database is created on the database
server and a new configuration for your apache webserver is created as
an additional virtual host configuration. Your apache server however
does
not yet know this. You will thus first need to restart apache in order
to be able to use the webinterface. After apache has been restarted you
should be able to use your web browser and go to
http://testcase.ocfa.loc/
<h3>Tuning the rulelist</h3>
The rulelist that is used by the router, a core module of the open
computer forensics architecture, is a configuration file that
determines how evidence flows through the different modules. You should
have a look at this file, ${OCFAROOT}/etc/rulelist.csv after
a standard install and edit it to meet your requirements. The most
important issue is to make sure there are no modules configured you
don't have available in your environment.
<h3>Starting up the modules</h3>
There are two ways to fire up the modules, the fast way and the
educational way. In any case you need to be <i>ocfa</i> again to do
this, log in again as ocfa or su to become ocfa.
<h4>Starting up the modules, the fast way</h4>
The fast way to start up all possible modules is the use of the script
startcase.pl. This script will parse&nbsp; the router its rulelist and
will
start up every conceivable module.
<pre class="example">startcase.pl testcase<br>     </pre>
<h4>Starting up the modules, the educational way</h4>
You may be interested to know what modules actually get used. So rather
than starting up each module you could start off by just starting the
anycastrelay.
<pre class="example">sbin/anycastrelay anycast anycast<br>     </pre>
Now you should point your browser to
http://testcase.ocfa.loc/cgi-bin/ppqoverview . This should give you a
view of any module present, but also of any module required. After you
submit evidence to the open computer forensics architecture (see below
the "Submitting evidence" section) you should
see some modules becoming required (their queues will fill up). If you
type:
<pre class="example">ls sbin<br>     </pre>
you should see many of the modules available. You should keep
monitoring the web interface and startup any module you see getting
required by the system.
<h3>Submitting evidence</h3>
Now that you have your system running you should be able to use
kickstart to submit some evidence to the open computer forensics
architecture. Lets say you had a PC labeled <i>bigbadserver</i> that
had a couple of scsi disks and two desktop pcs labeled <i>pc1</i>, <i>pc2</i>
and <i>laptop1</i> each with a single ide disk that you all imaged.
Kickstarting these images could go as follows
<pre class="example">kickstart testcase bigbadserver scsidisk1 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_bigbadserver_scsidisk1.dd<br>kickstart testcase bigbadserver scsidisk2 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_bigbadserver_scsidisk2.dd<br>kickstart testcase bigbadserver scsidisk3 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_bigbadserver_scsidisk3.dd<br>kickstart testcase bigbadserver scsidisk4 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_bigbadserver_scsidisk4.dd<br>kickstart testcase bigbadserver scsidisk5 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_bigbadserver_scsidisk5.dd<br>kickstart testcase bigbadserver scsidisk6 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_bigbadserver_scsidisk6.dd<br>kickstart testcase pc1 ide1 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_pc1_ide1.dd<br>kickstart testcase pc2 ide1 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_pc2_ide1.dd<br>kickstart testcase laptop1 ide1 /mnt/bigdisk/testcase_laptop1_ide1.dd<br>     </pre>
<h3>Monitoring what is happening</h3>
While and after you have kickstarted the image files you should be able
to monitor what is going on. If you have started the system in the <i>educational</i>
mode you must monitor in order to know what needs to be started in
addition to what is running.
<h4>ppqoverview</h4>
An important tool for seeing where obvious botlenecks are currently 
occuring is the ppqoverview webinterface. Point your browser to
http://testcase.ocfa.loc/cgi-bin/ppqoverview and you should see what
modules have queues and how big they are. If a module has a large queue
and is running this means the module can not fully keep up with the
rest of the system at this time. If a module has a queue and is not
running you may wish to start an instance of that module. Once you have
not seen any queue having had any content for a while you may use top
to see if things are really done or if a dissector that is processing a
big file (or a slow dissector processing a small file) is still
running.
<h4>top</h4>
With all modules running as the user ocfa, it is simple to monitor cpu
usage of the open computer forensics architecture for all parts of the
system on a single server:
<pre class="example">top -u ocfa<br>     </pre>
Once there have been no processes consuming any cpu for a while and no
queues are filled with any jobs either in the ppqoverview, it is
reasonably safe to assume the system is finished.
<h4>logfiles</h4>
While running, the open computer forensics architecture modules will
occasionally do some logging. By default logging will be done to the
syslog daemon that will log to a set of files in /var/log/ocfa/ . Each
log severity level comes with its own output file. If all goes well the
ocfa.error file should remain empty or at least unchanged in size. If
it does not, there is something wrong and you should consult the file
to
see what happened.
<h3>Stopping the case</h3>
Once all evidences are fully processed you should be able to stop them.
A simple small script is available to do this.
<pre class="example">ocfahalt testcase<br>     </pre>
You should point your web browser to
http://testcase.ocfa.loc/cgi-bin/ppqoverview and wait until the screen
is empty and all modules are thus stopped. Alternatively you could use
top and wait until only top and the shell are running.
<h3>Creating overviews</h3>
Many of the metadata queries needed to generate overviews are currently
rather uncomfortable to say the least when run from an interactive web
interface. The same is true for pages that need to generate a poststamp
overview of images. To alleviate the problems, a kind of hack has been
provided where these queries and conversions are run in advance in
order to create a tree of static html and png poststamp files. After
you have halted the architecture you should run this script in order to
be able to query the metadata:
<pre class="example">makeoverview.pl <br></pre>
<h3>The web interface</h3>
Now you should have <a href="../ocfaarch/metagui.html">multiple
interfaces to the data from the web
interface</a> at "http://testcase.ocfa.loc/". An interface for browsing
the tree of xml metadata and where needed the accompanying data files. An
interface for querying the Lucene text index. And finally an interface
for locating files based on metadata from the database. Future versions
will have combined querying for meta data and text data.<br>
