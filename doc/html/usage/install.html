<h2>Installing the Open Computer Forensics Architecture</h2>
<div class="shout"><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>
Don't install ocfa on a system serving vital interests! We take no
responsibility for any harm the installation of ocfa may do. It is advised
to install ocfa on a system dedicated for this purpose serving no other
functionality and to make backup copies of any important data beforehand.<br>
</div>
When installing the open computer forensics architecture from one of
the Linux distro specific packages you should simply follow the
instructions as provided in the accompanying howto for that platform.
This page describes what to do if you are installing from the separate
distribution file.
<h3>Satisfying the prerequisites</h3>
The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have all
depenedancies satisfied in order to continue installing the open
computer forensics architecture. Please check the <a
 href="prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a> to make sure you have the
dependencies all satisfied and are ready to install.
<h3>The basic install</h3>
The installation of the open computer forensics architecture will be
close to what you are used to, but with an important twist. Given the
fact that the actions needed to do a full install are sometimes rather
intrusive, and on non tested distributions even potentially dangerous
to
your systems usability, these actions have been moved out of the usual
'make install' into 'make rootinstall'.
<h4>Installation on <i>tested</i> distributions</h4>
When installing on one of the fully tested distributions (Debian etch,
Ubuntu 5.10, Suse 9.3 or Suse 10.1) you can safely use the following
steps in each of the 3 packages OcfaLib,OcfaArch and OcfaModules
(please make sure to strictly adhere to the Lib/Arch/Modules sequence):
<pre class="example">./configure<br>make<br>make rootinstall<br>     </pre>
Please make sure to check out any warnings that the configure script
gives. You can safely ignore warnings about libmidas in OcfaModules as
the midas module is now considered deprecated.
<h4>Installation on other distributions and platforms</h4>
If you are installing on any system other than the ones officially
marked as tested, you need to be a bit more careful during
installation in order not to break things.<br>
First you will need to give the configure script a try. Run <i>./configure</i>
. This script may issue some warnings, please check these out. The
script will create a file <i>configure.makeinfo</i>, you should have a
good look in this file to see if anything is obviously wrong here.<br>
<br>
After having checked configure.makeinfo for errors you can run <i>make</i>.
If make runs without errors, which in theory it should, you are most of
the way to a working environment, we will tread carefully however in
order to make sure we won't break your system. Instead of running
rootinstall you should simply run <i>make install</i>. This will leave
the installation partially broken but at least should keep your system
intact.<br>
<br>
<div class="shout"><b>IMPORTANT:</b><br>
You are discouraged to just run the scripts, they are
untested on any but the distributions mentioned in the previous section
</div>
Now comes the hard part, you will need to look very closely at the
makefile and any script called from the makefile. Look at the file
called <i>Makefile</i> and look for the definition of DISTDIR, you
should export this in your shell. After this, look at the section
called <i>rootinstall</i> and check out each of the lines to see if it
should be applicable for your system. Most regular lines should be applicable and
you should be able to run these from your shell. Some lines in the
rootinstall section however will call on scripts that could potentially
be dangerous. It is essential that you locate these scripts, read their
content to find out what they intend to do, and then do those things
yourself by hand. You are discouraged to just run the scripts, they are
untested on any but the distributions mentioned in the previous section.<br>
