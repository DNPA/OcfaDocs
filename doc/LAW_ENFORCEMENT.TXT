The base OCFA distribution contains basic modules within the OcfaModules directory tree.
These modules contain the base functionality for some generic filetypes, and no work 
other than bugfixes will be done after the 2.1 release of OCFA.
The OcfaArch tree comes with a simple and complete but archaic and sometimes slow 
frontend, and after the 2.1 release no work other than bugfixes will be done.

Next to these modules, the KLPD is now actively working on some more specialized and/or
optimized modules, and on a more up to date and fast frontend. Both of these will not be 
distributed with the GPL/LGPL licenced publicly available ocfa distribution, but instead 
will be made available only under NDA. For information on nda disclosure of OcfaNDAModules
and DUIF please contact ocfa@dnpa.nl
