In addition to the 6 NF requirements listed in nf-requirements.txt, the 0.1 version
of the open computer forensic architecture architectural design implemented an
additional NF requirement. As the 0.1 design did not document the NF requirements,
and the 0.3 refactoring was done by another architect, unfortunately the implementation
of this requirement was nullified in the refactoring process.
If at any point in the future another round of refactoring will be done on the architectural
level, then this NF requirement should get re-introduced.

7) Least Authority

   To counteract the security implications of opportunistic development, the architecture
   must grant 'least authority' to individual opportunistic modules. This means that
   the library, core modules and the architectural setup should implement the principle
   of least authority up to the point that module should only have access to the evidence
   data and meta data that is 'explicitly' designated to it. Further this access should
   not be allowed to exceed the designed functionality of the module.
