<module name="objdump">
  <function>
    This module looks at executable files using the objdump tool.
    It generates a list of pagenames as defined in the executable file.
    Further it looks for code pages that are marked as writable.
    Writable code pages mostly point to the executable being a packed 
    executables. Some regular software is packed, but almost all 
    mallware is packed, thus packed executables have a relatively high
    probability of being mallware. Finaly the executable is checked for
    being generated as a winzip self extracting archive.
