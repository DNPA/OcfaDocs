This short memo describes a database-only replacement for the makeoverview
script. For efficient cgi based overviews as replacement of the pre
generated html pages, we should create additional tables on the frontend
database. We will take a liberal approach to table creation.
It is suggested that the creation of these tables move to parkcase/preparetogui.

First, to distinguish overview tables from regular tables we define
a prefix 'ov' to be used on all overview table names.

The overview's base view is based on the subdivision according to the
digest source (DS) and item (IT), where each can be a wildcard.
To facilitate this, we define a table prefix P2. The P2 prefix is
defined as follows:

  g   		:   both DS and IT are considered wildcards here.
  i<IT>		:   DS is considdered a wildcard for these tables.
  d<DS>		:   IT is considdered a wildcard for these tables.
  s<IT>_<DS>    :   Both DS and IT are specified.

For each of the thus defined prefixes we define the following tables:

The keys table for the main overview.

  keys
    *  meta_name   : The name of the meta data
    *  dist        : The number of distinct values for thus named metadata.

The meta count tables. Please note that these tables should only get created for meta keys
that result in a reasonably limited set of distinct values. 

  _<META>           : The name of the meta data
    *  meta_val    : The value of the meta data
    *  count       : The number of evidence files that hold this value for this metadata.

The calendar tables:

   calendar
     * name        : The key of the timestamp matadata.
     * source      : The timesource string.
     * day         : Must we explain ?
     * count       : The number of evidence files that hold this value for the timestamp metadata.

As an example, the full case wide calendar table would be named 'ovgcalender' while a calender table
for all evidences with a digest source 'KP' in item '19' would be named 'ovs19_KPcalendar'
