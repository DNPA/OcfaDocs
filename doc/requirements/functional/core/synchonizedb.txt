The (upcoming) synchonizedb tool should implement the following specifications:

* Move any active lucene index file to the WDFE index directory.
* Move any item not moved earlier from the ocfa database to the WDFE database.
* Create or update indices on the WDFE database to optimize for usage by WDFE.
* Create/update convenience tables in the WDFE database for usage by 'overview' functionality.
* Create thumbnails from any image data and store them as BLOB in the WDFE database for
  overview functionality.
* Create/update tables for user supplied metadata and navigation aids.

The tool should deprecate both makeoverview and parkcase.
