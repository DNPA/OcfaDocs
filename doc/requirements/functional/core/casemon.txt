The casemon program deprecates the older startwash program.
Casemon should implement the following functionality:

1) Casemon should start the anycastrelay.
2) Casemon should start ocfa core modules like the dsm and router "on demand".
3) Casemon should start ocfa modules "on demand".
4) Casemon should start w32proxies for modules that should be
   running on the w32 application server "on demand".
5) Casemon should restart crashed modules.
6) Casemon should maintain 'health' information on running modules, and should
   determine if a module is 'broken'.
7) For modules marked as 'broken' casemon should refrain from restarting crashed modules.
