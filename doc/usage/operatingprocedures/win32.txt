For the configuration of a win32 satellite system, please first consult
the fileservers.txt file, especially item 2.

After configuring the proper fileserver configuration for your local system,
you should get yourself a copy of the KLPD (Dutch National Police Agency) 'washbrush'. This set of tools
is available currently to law enforcement. 
The washbrush currently contains modules for outlook, outlook express,
excel sheets and ocr that are quite usable as satellite module for ocfa.
Most of these tools require you to purchase some comercially available 
software, that the satellite is built as a wrapper for.
Wider availability of the win32 satellite modules is still under consideration.
For more information please contact the digital expertise team (TDE) of
the national crime squad (NR)  of the Dutch National Police Agency (KLPD).
