After you have processed all images of an investigation of at least a substantial part of the images,
you may desire to have access to some metadata based overviews. 
It is important to note however that the current tool to create such an overview suffers from
scalability issues, and will need to be replaced in upcoming versions. 
For this reason it is suggested to run the script 'makeoverview.pl' only after the case has been
largely processed by the main architecture. 
The script should be run as the user ocfa with the proper enviroment settings (run the profile).
The overview script will create a directory tree with the following metadata views:

 * A generic view with distinct metadata values and the number of occurences, linking
   to a search result page with the matching data files.
 * For each 'timestamp' metadata type, a calender view linking to search results
   with matching data files for particular dates.
 * A thumbnail view of all found images.

These are all quite useful views, but as the script is not very scalable and takes up
processing resources, it is suggested to only run it when a large portion of the images
has been fully processed.

Further it is strongly suggested, as the script may run for weeks, that the script is
started from a screen session (for information on screen consult the screen manual).

Upcoming versions of OCFA should divide and integrate the overview functionality
into the frontend and the frontend database migration tool.
