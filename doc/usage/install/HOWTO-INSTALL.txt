!! WARNING: This document has not been updated since the 2.0 OCFA release.  !!!

This release, the 2.1.0 version only is distributed as the plain sources
without the specific packages for specific distributions.

As of the 2.0.5 the installation howto's for platforms other than 
debian etch are no longer actively maintained. 
And the klpd (Dutch National Police Agency) has stopped the distribution 
of binary packages for libraries and tools that are not pressent as standard 
packages for the given linux distributions.

The base platform that the open computer forensics architecture is developed
on and for is:

* debian etch

The file HOWTO-INSTALL-debian-etch.txt contains a howto on installing the
open computer forensics architecture on this platform.

Currently the following Linux distro's have also been confirmed to work with ocfa:

* suse 9.3
* suse 10.1
* ubuntu 5.10

This directory contains 'old' howto files on how to install the system on
these platforms. Please try to use the debian howto as guideline while 
using any of these unmaintained howto files for suse or ubuntu.

If you find any inconsistencies in the provided howto or packages for these
distro's please let us know at ocfa@dnpa.nl . If you manage to install
ocfa on any other distro, please inform us of this and of any additional 
steps you needed to take in order to get stuff running. We can not test
ocfa on every distro, so any information you provide could potentially help
other users of your distro to become able to use ocfa.

After successful installation please consider subscribing to the ocfa-user
mailing-list. Ocfa is a big project with many dependencies, and we have
very little resources to support users that are not members of the Dutch 
national police, especially with dependency issues on different Linux
distributions and versions. The ocfa-user mailing-list is meant both to 
keep users informed about new developments and to act as a user community 
support mailing-list.
