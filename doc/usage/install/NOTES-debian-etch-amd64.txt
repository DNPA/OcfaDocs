!! WARNING: This document has not been updated since the 2.0 OCFA release.  !!!

Where the i386 version of debian etch works with ocfa using
the standard etch packages, part of the boost library on
amd64 does not come with the required shared libraries.
For this reason, if using the amd64 version of debian etch,
you should build the boost library from source.

First make sure that you have removed all boost packages.
After this you should fetch the sources of boost from 
boost.org, build them with so support according to the
documentation that comes with boost.

Boost will install in /usr/local, you may need to patch
your /etc/ld.so.conf file after installation, and/or
might need to run ldconfig.
