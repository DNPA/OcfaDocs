First make sure you have read HOWTO-INSTALL 

--------------- Install Debian Etch----------------------
This howto describes how to configure the Linux server
that forms the core of the open computer forensics architecture
on a Debian etch linux distribution.

First a litle word about the hardware. It is suggested that you
use a system with sufficient hard disk space, either internal
or better yet with a connection to a SAN. Preferably use a local
system disk of at least 40GB combined with either a small set of 
big internal disks, or with an external SAN or RAID system that
should hold at least one or two terabytes of storage.
It is also sugested that the system should have at least 2GB of
system memory, preferably more, especialy if it is going to also 
be running the database server.

You should obtain the installation media from debian.org.
It is suggested to use the netinstall CD iso image.

Boot from cd and go through the normal installation.
When partitioning the disk it is suggested that you partition 
the disk internal main system disk as follows:

1			2GB		swap
1	/boot		200 MB		ext3
3	/var/log	10 GB		xfs
4	/		remaining	xfs

If the disk is smaller then 40GB you may wish to leave out the
seperate /var/log partition. You should then however be careful
with using debug logs that might fill up the root partition.

For all remaining disks you should create one large partition
for each disk, and mark this for usage by logical volume management.
After declaring these partitions you should set up a volume group
containing these partitions, and for that group you should then
define a single big logical volume.

The big logical volume (or SAN slice or RAID volume) should get a single
partition defined for it:

5	/var/ocfa	full-size	xfs

You may wish to make sure that the /var/ocfa partition be mounted with the 'noatime'
flag. This will potentially make access to the ocfa repository a lot faster.

When presented with 'Software selection' you should select:

 * File Server
 * DNS Server
 * Standard System

You may in addition also want to choose the graphical desktop system if the 
target system is a desktop. 

When asked to enter a username, DO IN NO CASE ENTER 'ocfa'
as the username (this will conflict with later installation checks), 
You can choose any other name you desire. 

You will be asked for a workgroup name for samba, it is suggested that you choose
'ocfa'.

After reboot, login as root.
Unless otherwise noted further installation is done as root.

Run 'apt-get update'.

Use 'apt-get install <package> for the folowing packages,
as an alternative you could use 'aptitude'.

* bzip2
* libxerces27-dev
* libtool
* libboost-dev
* libboost-serialization-dev
* libssl-dev
* postgresql-dev
* libboost-regex-dev
* libdb4.4-dev
* exiftags
* unzip
* antiword
* xpdf-utils
* libmagic-dev
* apache2
* libmime-perl
* openssh-server
* netpbm
* sleuthkit
* cgicc-dev
* libace-dev
* g++
* libfuse-dev
* fuse-utils
* lynx

Optionally you may wish to install the folowing packages that will be required
by upcoming releases of ocfa:

* libextractor-dev
* extract
* mdbtools
* nrg2iso

If you are installing a stand alone system you will also want to
install a database server:

* postgresql-8.1

You may however also choose to install and configure postgresql on
a second server as a more scalable alternative.

While most tools and libraries may be available as debian packages,
some are not, or are currently only available as an incompatible
or broken version. 
First we may need to make sure that your system will be able to find these
hand-installed packages, to be more precise, able to find the libraries
we will install from source.

Edit (or create) the file /etc/ld.so.conf and make sure it contains a line
with the string '/usr/local/lib'. After installing a library please run
'ldconfig' to make sure the loader can find your libraries.

Now go on and install the folowing packages from source:

* clucene 0.9.16
* libewf-beta-20061233
* libcarvpath-0.1.4
* carvfs-0.2.1

Optionally, if you want to play around a bit with the upcoming carvpath 
functionality you may also want to install:

* sleuthkit-2.07 with the patches from the carvfs-0.2.1 tree.
* scalpel 1.60

------------------- Installing OcfaLib -----------------------
Now build and install the OcfaLib.
Cd to the OcfaLib directory and (as root) run the following commands:

  ./configure
  make install

------------------Installing OcfaArch------------------------
Now we can start with installing OcfaArch:

  cd to the OcfaArch directory

Now we can configure and build OcfaArch

  ./configure
  make install

During 'make rootinstall' you will be asked two important questions.
The first question asks if the database should be configured. 
If you are going to install a separate database server you should 
choose not to do so. However not configuring a local database also means
you won't be able to test your installation before you completed the
database server install.
The second question asks how you will use the installation, either as
an evaluation and testing system or as a production system. 
The difference between these is that a testing system will allow you
to edit and tune your configuration without administrator priviledges.
Choose the one most appropriate for your situation.
If you choose to configure the database, some important changes to the 
database configuration are made. You will need to restart your database 
for these changes to take effect.

  /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.1 restart

You now will want to change the password for the ocfa user:

  passwd ocfa


------------------Testing OcfaArch-------------------------
Optionally you may now test the OcfaArch installation.
Please consult HOWTO-INSTALLTEST for details.
If you chose to use a separate database, please first install this server 
creating a user 'ocfa' on this server with proper rights.
You should also change your /usr/local/digiwash2.0/etc/template.conf file 
to point to the proper database server prior to running the tests.


-----------------OcfaModules install-----------------------

Finally we will install OcfaModules. This will install
very cleanly:

cd to the OcfaModules directory and run the folowing commands: 

  ./configure
  make install


-------------- Digest database creation ---------------------------
The 'digest' module is dependent on a set of berkeleydb database files for proper
operation. In order to use the digest module you need to install the digest
database files:

If you are installing the publically available ocfa distribution 
you will not have the pre-build databases available and you will
thus need to build the digest files yourself. To do this you should
get the NIST digest database iso files, unpack them on your
system and use a script provided for building the digest db.

Change your directory to OcfaModules/minimal/digest/init/ .
Here you find a script called createshadb2.pl.
Remember where your NIST files are to be found and start
createshadb2.pl. The script will ask for input.
Ones the script has finished move the digest files to
/usr/local/digiwash2.0/static/hashsets/


Now you should do a testrun, consult HOWTO-TESTSET.txt for details.
