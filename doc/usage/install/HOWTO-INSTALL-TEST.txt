------------------Testing OcfaArch-------------------------
After installation you should have an absolute minimum OCFA system. You may check if
installation thusfar is successful by performing a litle testrun.
This section is optional, if you are sure that you dont want to test at this stage then
please continue with the OcfaModules installation section
First you will need to prepare your name resolution for the test. Edit your /etc/hosts file
and add the name 'test.ocfa.loc' to the end of your localhost entry.

Now run:

  su - ocfa

You will now become the 'ocfa' user. The system should ask you for a case you
want to use, just type 'test'. You will be warned about the fact that there is no such
case defined, so you continue by creating the case named test. The default db user ocfa
was created with 'ocfa' as password, you may want to change this later on, but for the
test just leave it as it is and type:

  createcase.pl test ocfa

Now you have created the case called 'test'. Log out again, and restart apache.

  /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Now you can already go to your browser and type the adress http://test.ocfa.loc/ .
You should choose the 'Current queues' link and keep the window open to see what hapens.

Again log in or su to the user ocfa. Again choose the case 'test'.
Now the first thing you need to do is start up an anycast relay server.

  sbin/anycastrelay anycast anycast

No actual modules are running yet, but the anycast is there to hold on to anything
you would be sending to the modules until the modules are there. You should now
kickstart a directory with a few hundred files in it:

  kickstart test testevidence testitem2 /usr/local/digiwash2.0/

When looking at the web page, you should see a queue for 'router' that should have a few
hundred items in it. There is no router running yet, so we start one:

  sbin/router

Now you will see all items moving from the router queue to the dsm queue. Lets also start
the dsm:

  sbin/dsm

Now the interface will show that all queues will eventually empty. After the queues are empty wait
a few minutes and type:

  ocfahalt

If you now push the back button of your browser and choose 'Bekijk de boom' (this is dutch for view
the tree), you should be able to browse the metadata.
Now run:

  makemetaindex.pl

This script will create an index page based on meta data, go back to the main page and select
'Database Metadata View'. Given that there are not any modules running, just the router and the
data store module, there should be litle to select, but make some selections and view the result.

If all has gone well you should have been able to search and browse the metadata, and you should
be able to move on to the OcfaModules package. Before continuing however, lets remove our test
data and database:

   deletecase.sh test

Now you may continue to the installation of OcfaModules, once finished you may repeat the
tests described abouve starting the aditional modules as required. 
You need to note that you should not kickstart twice using the same case/evidencesource/itemname
combination. (The reason for this is that the system derives unique evidence identifiers from
the case/evidencesource/itemname identifiers, and couples this to the toolchain trace for this
unique evidence. Thus in order to prevent ambiguity, each unique case/evidencesource/itemname should
be kickstarted only ones. ) 
(FIXME: Why not kickstart twice?)
