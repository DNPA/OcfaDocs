This text gives a short introduction to usage of the keyword search interface.

The keyword search interface can either be accessed directly or (as scoped keyword
search) from the results page of an overview interface.

The keyword search interface is built on top of the lucene indexer, thus you are
encouraged to consult the lucene documentation for information on how to construct
more complex queries for lucene.
